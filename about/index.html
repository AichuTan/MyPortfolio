<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
I’m Aichu Tan, a data enthusiast with a background in engineering and a passion for geospatial technology. 
Before pursuing my graduate studies in Big Data Analytics at SDSU, I worked as a process engineer in the DRAM industry and 
later founded an online clothing business. These experiences shaped my analytical thinking and entrepreneurial spirit.
</p>

<p>
At SDSU, I’ve been exploring the intersection of data science, web technologies, and machine learning. I’m particularly drawn 
to projects that have real-world impact — such as improving farming outcomes using AI or making public data more accessible through visualization.
</p>

<p>
In my free time, I enjoy hiking, experimenting with new coding tools, and contributing to open-source projects that promote sustainability.
