      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Aichu Tan.<br> I am currently a graduate student in Big
        Data Analytics at San Diego State University. This website highlights a
        collection of my academic and personal projects, with a focus on web
        mapping, data analytics, and artificial intelligence. </p>
      <p>  Many of these projects were developed during graduate coursework and reflect my
        passion for geospatial technology, database systems, and applying
        machine learning to real-world problems such as agriculture and public
        data visualization.
